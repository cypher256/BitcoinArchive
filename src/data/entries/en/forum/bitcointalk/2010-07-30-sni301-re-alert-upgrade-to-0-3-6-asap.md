**sudo apt-get install libboost1.37-dev**
Except that wouldn't work for boost 1.40+ (on Ubuntu 10.04), where you need to get libboost-all-dev.

Seems they changed everything around in Boost recently, "-mt" and all that, makes it hard.

BTW, I tried Boost 1.34 but it didn't have the boost.interprocess stuff.

Mac OSX version is available now.  See bitcoin.org or the SourceForge link.
