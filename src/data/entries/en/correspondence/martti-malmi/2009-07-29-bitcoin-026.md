I've had quite a few errors coming up when trying to build the  
third-party libraries and adding them to the Bitcoin build. Do you  
happen to have a ready-to-build package that you could upload to the  
CVS or somewhere else? I use mingw + msys, but I guess I could try  
Visual C++ also, if it's easier that way.
