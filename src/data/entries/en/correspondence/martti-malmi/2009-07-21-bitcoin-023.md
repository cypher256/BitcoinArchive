Hi,

I made a post on the Bitcoin developer's forum at SF about a month ago  
and sent you, David and Hal a notification about it to your  
users.sourceforge.net emails. A few days ago I wondered why no one had  
replied, and tried if the SF mail aliases even work - and they didn't,  
at least in the case of my account. So could you please forward this  
message to the others?

Best regards,
sirius-m
