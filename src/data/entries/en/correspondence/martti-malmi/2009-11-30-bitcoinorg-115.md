It would be also great if you can get the Sourceforge logo from the SF  
project admin and add it to the site footer.

> The current site layout looks nice and simple. The logo just should be
> changed. If we want to go live quickly, we can just replace it with the
> site title and make a better logo later.
>
> If we need help with site administration or contacts to professional
> web graphic artists, we can ask Dave. He does Drupal stuff for work.
