Have you decided upon the inter-process calling method of the Bitcoin  
API yet? An easy solution would be the socket interface provided by  
wxWidgets: http://docs.wxwidgets.org/trunk/overview_ipc.html. The  
Bitcoin program running a wxServer could be then accessed by calling  
the bitcoin executable from the command line or by coding your own  
wxClient app.

Another option would be to just use the plain BSD sockets.

Can you send me a 64-bit Linux binary of Bitcoin if you have one? I  
tried compiling on the VPS, but it ran out of memory. Tried the 32-bit  
version (with ia32-libs) also, but it didn't find the shared libraries.
