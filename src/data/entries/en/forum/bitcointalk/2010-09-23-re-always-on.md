The network can survive being split into pieces. When it reconnects, the shorter chain will be discarded and the longer one continued. There are no essential nodes. The network doesn't have single points of failure.

Even if only one person was still running a node with the complete block chain, that's all it takes for the network to pick up where it left off.
