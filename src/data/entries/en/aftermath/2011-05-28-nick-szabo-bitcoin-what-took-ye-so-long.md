Nearly everybody who heard the general idea thought it was a very bad idea.

The short answer about why it took so long is that the bit gold/Bitcoin ideas were nowhere remotely close to being as obvious as gwern suggests.

I came up with them in 1998... mostly not described in public until 2005.

Nakamoto improved a significant security shortcoming that my design had, namely by requiring proof-of-work to be a node in a Byzantine-resilient peer-to-peer system to greatly reduce the threat of an untrustworthy party controlling the majority of nodes.

Bitcoin is far more susceptible to radical deflation than gold.

*[Published on the Unenumerated blog, May 28, 2011. Nick Szabo is the creator of the bit gold concept (1998/2005), a direct precursor to Bitcoin. While some have speculated Szabo could be Satoshi Nakamoto, he has denied this. His blog post discusses the intellectual history of digital cash and why the ideas took over a decade to materialize into a working system.]*
