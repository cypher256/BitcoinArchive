I've done a Joomla site for a customer, and I must say I like Drupal  
better, mostly for the admin interface which is easier to use and  
integrated into the main site.

Images aren't loading properly over https, I'll check it out when I can.

It's easier to just change the bitcoin.org DNS entry,  
forum.bitcoin.org is not necessary.

We could see if we can get a free SSL certificate somewhere, like  
http://www.startssl.com/?app=1, so the users wouldn't get a security  
warning from a self-signed certificate. However I don't know if they  
give certificates for anonymously registered domains.
