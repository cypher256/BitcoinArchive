On June 14, 2011, WikiLeaks tweeted:

This came after a financial blockade imposed on WikiLeaks following the CableGate scandal in November 2010. Bank of America, Visa, MasterCard, PayPal, and Western Union had all blocked donations to the organization, cutting off an estimated 95% of its revenue.

Six months earlier, on December 5, 2010, Satoshi Nakamoto had warned the community against WikiLeaks adopting Bitcoin, writing: "The project needs to grow gradually so the software can be strengthened along the way. I make this appeal to WikiLeaks not to try to use Bitcoin." WikiLeaks respected Satoshi's concern and delayed adoption — notably, the announcement came two months after Satoshi's final departure.

Bitcoin proved to be WikiLeaks' lifeline. By 2016, the organization had raised over 4,000 BTC through Bitcoin donations. Julian Assange later stated: "The American government forced us to invest in Bitcoin — thanks to the financial blockade. We got a 50,000% return."

The episode demonstrated exactly the use case Satoshi had designed Bitcoin for: censorship-resistant value transfer that no central authority could block. It also vindicated Satoshi's concern that premature political attention could endanger Bitcoin before it was ready.
