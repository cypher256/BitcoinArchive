In this email from June 11, 2009, Satoshi praised the improvements Malmi had made to the bitcoin.org website. He again requested removal of investment-related language, consistent with his earlier stance.

Most notably, Satoshi introduced the term "cryptocurrency" in this exchange:

> Someone came up with the word 'cryptocurrency'... maybe it's a word we should use when describing Bitcoin, do you like it?

The following day, Malmi replied that "it sounds good" and proposed "P2P Cryptocurrency" as a marketing tagline for Bitcoin. This exchange is historically significant because it challenges the assumption that Satoshi himself coined the term "cryptocurrency" - instead, he was relaying a term someone else had suggested, asking for Malmi's opinion on adopting it.

During this period, Malmi had been actively improving the bitcoin.org website infrastructure, having installed Bitweaver to support wikis, forums, and community features. Satoshi registered the username "satoshi" with moderator permissions on the new site.
