On January 3, 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto mined the first block of the Bitcoin blockchain, known as the Genesis Block or Block 0. The block's coinbase transaction contained the following embedded text:

"The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks"

This message, a headline from the front page of The Times newspaper published on that date, serves dual purposes. It acts as a timestamp proving the block could not have been mined before January 3, 2009, and it provides a pointed commentary on the instability of the traditional banking system -- the very problem Bitcoin was designed to address.

The Genesis Block is hardcoded into the Bitcoin software and is the foundation upon which the entire blockchain is built. Unlike all subsequent blocks, the 50 BTC reward from the Genesis Block's coinbase transaction is unspendable due to a quirk in the original code.

The block hash is:

000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f

The Genesis Block was mined six days before the next block (Block 1) on January 9, 2009, the same day Bitcoin v0.1 was released to the public. This gap suggests Satoshi may have mined the Genesis Block separately to test the system before the public launch.
