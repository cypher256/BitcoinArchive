Running bitcoin

*[@halfin — January 10, 2009 10:33 PM PST / January 11, 2009 06:33 UTC]*

*[This two-word tweet is widely considered the first tweet ever about Bitcoin. Hal Finney posted it from his home in Santa Barbara, California, the same day the Bitcoin v0.1 software was publicly released. Two days later, on January 12, 2009, Satoshi sent Hal the first-ever Bitcoin transaction: 10 BTC (Transaction ID: f4184fc596403b9d638783cf57adfe4c75c605f6356fbc91338530e9831e9e16). The tweet received virtually no reaction at the time.]*
