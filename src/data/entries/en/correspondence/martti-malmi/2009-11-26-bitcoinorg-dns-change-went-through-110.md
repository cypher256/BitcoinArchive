The bitcoin.org DNS change went through about 12 hours ago.  I'll wait 
another 12 hours and then change the Forum tab on 
bitcoin.sourceforge.net to go to http://www.bitcoin.org/smf/

For future reference, the changes in SMF to update the base url were:
   server settings->Forum URL
   themes and layout->attempt to reset all themes
   there's a path in smileys and message icons
