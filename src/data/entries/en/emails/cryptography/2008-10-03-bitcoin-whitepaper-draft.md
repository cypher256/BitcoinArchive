This is an early draft of the Bitcoin whitepaper, dated October 3, 2008.

This draft predates the final published version by nearly a month. It was shared privately by Satoshi Nakamoto with selected individuals before the public announcement on the Cryptography Mailing List on October 31, 2008.

The draft demonstrates that the core concepts of Bitcoin — proof-of-work chain, peer-to-peer network, and double-spending prevention — were already well-developed weeks before the public announcement.
