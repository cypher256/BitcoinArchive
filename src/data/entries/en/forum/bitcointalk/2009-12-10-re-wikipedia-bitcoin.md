The Bitcoin Wikipedia article has been nominated for deletion. Please help by contributing to the Wikipedia article and improving it so it meets Wikipedia's standards.

Bitcoin is a remarkable cryptographic achievement and the ability to create something that is not duplicable in the digital world has enormous value.

I hope we can make the article better. The community has grown a lot since the article was first written. There should be enough content and references to satisfy Wikipedia's notability requirements now.
