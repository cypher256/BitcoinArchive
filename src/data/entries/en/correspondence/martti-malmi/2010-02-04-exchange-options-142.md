Don't rush ahead and get yourself rejected from all the payment options 
before you've had time to see if there's a better approach.  I suggest 
you wait before contacting any more payment processors.  You may get 
ideas from things other users come up with and try.

Just some random incomplete ideas: There may be a way to position it as 
an intermediate credit for micropayments for some virtual good or 
something.  Or maybe if the payments are only in one direction.  If you 
only buy bitcoins, then you're only sending money out not taking 
people's money, that would still be useful to peg the currency.  That 
might be payment for computer time.

Credit card is only one way.  Don't even talk about the idea of 
returning money to customer's credit cards.  Credit card companies hate 
that.

In any case, any payment processor is going to expect you to be selling 
something real.

Do you have electronic transfer or paper cheque in your country? (even 
if only within Europe)
