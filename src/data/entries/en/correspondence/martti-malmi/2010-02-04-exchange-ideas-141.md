You could always exchange for Liberty Reserve.  It's an online currency 
similar to e-Bullion, Pecunix or Webmoney that allows exchanges no 
questions asked and with privacy.

LR and the others are hard to buy but easy to cash out.  Hard to buy 
because exchangers are very cautious about getting ripped off by 
reversed payments, so they require more details and holding time. 
Cashing out is very easy.  LR is non-reversible, so there are oodles of 
exchanges eager to turn LR into any kind of payment.

Bitcoin is the reverse, in that it's easy to get Bitcoins just by 
generating them.  It would be easy for customers to go 
bitcoin->LR->cash, bitcoin->LR->gold, bitcoin->LR->paypal or maybe they 
just want to save the money, then just bitcoin->LR.

There's also the idea BTC2PSC had to sell paysafecards for bitcoins. 
Either online delivery by sending the card number by e-mail, or delivery 
of the unopened physical card in the mails.  There are many variations 
of these cards.  In some countries, they're called Gift Cards, and can 
be used wherever credit cards are accepted.  I think they're used more 
by people who don't have the credit history to get a real credit card, 
so they buy gift cards themselves to pay for things that require a 
credit card.
