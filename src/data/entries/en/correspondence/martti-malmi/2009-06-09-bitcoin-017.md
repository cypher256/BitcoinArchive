I couldn't get TikiWiki to work, so I installed Bitweaver, which is a  
lightweight TikiWiki derivative. Its functionality looks good for the

The admin account password is Wubreches3eS again. New users can  
register to the site and write to the wiki and the forums. Next I'm  
going to look into how custom menus and custom layouts are made.
