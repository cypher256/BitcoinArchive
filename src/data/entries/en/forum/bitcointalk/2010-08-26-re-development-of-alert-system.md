that he hands over his key (or get it from his computer) and shut down the complete network?

Or is that not possible? How far would <some goverment> get?
This is what makes me think the people objecting don't know what they're talking about.  It can't "shut down the complete network". 
I've never objected this change/idea, just asking if this was possible and to what extent.
What's wrong with getting informed? 
My apologies, your post was indeed a question not a statement.
