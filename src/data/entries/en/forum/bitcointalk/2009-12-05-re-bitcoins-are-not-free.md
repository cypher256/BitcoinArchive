The generation of coins is analogous to gold miners expending resources to add gold to circulation. In our case, it is CPU time and electricity that is expended.

Right now, the generation difficulty is set so low that coins are practically free. But as word spreads and more people participate, the difficulty will increase.

After a number of years, the production of new coins will be minimal and the value will be determined purely by supply and demand.
