Just letting you know I'm still working on the Linux build so we don't 
duplicate work.  I got it linked and ran it and working through runtime 
issues like getting it switched to load bitmaps from xpm instead of 
resources.

There are debian packages available for some of the dependencies instead 
of having to compile them ourselves:
apt-get install build-essential
apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev
apt-get install libssl-dev

I need to see if Berkeley DB or Boost have packages.

We'll shared-link OpenSSL, I'm pretty sure it's always preinstalled on 
Linux.  GTK has to be shared linked.  I'm not completely sure if it's 
preinstalled by default.
