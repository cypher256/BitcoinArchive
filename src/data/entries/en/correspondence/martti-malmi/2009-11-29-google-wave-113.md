I just watched the Google Wave introduction video at wave.google.com.  
It's the Google's open source proposal for a replacement for the  
decades old e-mail protocol, and it looked quite cool. A "wave" is a  
communication and collaboration unit that can be read and edited by  
multiple users in real time and easily shared to new users, unlike  
e-mail threads. It combines the functionality of instant messaging,  
wikis, conventional e-mail and social networking, and supports  
integration with external applications.

If you want invites, you can give me the e-mail addresses where you  
want them to. If you already have Wave addresses, please give me them  
as well. It would be great to see how the system works in practice.
