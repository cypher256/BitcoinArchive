Yes, using Python. I didn't test the JSON-RPC yet as I don't have  
Bitcoin running on the vps yet. It doesn't work without a window  
manager even if GTK libraries are installed. I asked about it at  
wxWidgets forum (http://wxforum.shadonet.com/viewtopic.php?t=26954)  
but they didn't have much clue. Maybe we'll just need to make two  
different binaries.
