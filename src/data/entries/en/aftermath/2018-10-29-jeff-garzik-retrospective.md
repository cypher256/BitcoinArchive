*From BREAKER Magazine, October 29, 2018:*

Jeff Garzik discovered Bitcoin through a Slashdot post announcing Bitcoin v0.3 in July 2010 — the "Great Slashdotting." He spent five years as a Bitcoin core developer while working at Red Hat. At one point, his fingerprint on Bitcoin's codebase was the third-largest after Satoshi Nakamoto and Gavin Andresen.

Satoshi was "practical and sane, which made interactions very easy and comfortable."

Satoshi's anonymity "encouraged volunteers to rely on trusting the objective reality of the code, rather than whether the project leader had conventional credentials."

Garzik's development process: he would write a software change, test it, create a software patch, and email it to Satoshi. If Satoshi accepted it, it would be merged into the Subversion source code repository.

Satoshi "never used his voice at all — no video, no voice chat, no casual conversations."

*From CoinDesk interview, July 9, 2013:*

Satoshi was "a fantastic designer and architect" who "thought about the system at a very deep level."

Satoshi "spent a couple of years thinking about the system, and then had to write the system to prove to himself that it would work."

He "rarely followed standard engineering practices, like writing unit or stress tests."

The original Bitcoin was Windows-only, poorly portable, and "a jumble of source code."

Several features required immediate disabling upon public release because they were "obviously exploitable."

*[Garzik's initial work focused on optimizing blockchain downloads, creating code that "increased the speed of the initial download by 10x-100x." He later became CEO of Bloq and Hemi Network.]*
