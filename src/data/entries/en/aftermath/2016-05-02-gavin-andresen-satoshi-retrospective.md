Gavin Andresen first discovered Bitcoin in 2010 and quickly became one of the most active contributors. Satoshi Nakamoto recognized his talent and commitment, eventually giving him access to the Bitcoin source code repository and naming him lead developer.

In one of their exchanges, Satoshi told Gavin: "I've moved on to other things. It's in good hands with Gavin and everyone."

Gavin's involvement was critical during the transition period after Satoshi's departure. He was the last known person to exchange emails with Satoshi before Satoshi disappeared from public communication in April 2011.

When Gavin mentioned to Satoshi that he had been invited to speak at the CIA about Bitcoin, Satoshi's communications became less frequent and eventually ceased entirely.
