Bitcoin v0.3.19 was released on SourceForge on December 15, 2010. This was the final Bitcoin release from Satoshi Nakamoto, marking the end of his direct involvement in Bitcoin's software development.

Changes in v0.3.19:
- Added some DoS limits, though Satoshi noted it was "still far from DoS resistant"
- Removed "safe mode" alerts

Satoshi described this as "a minor release to add some DoS protection." The DoS (Denial of Service) protections were aimed at hardening the network against attacks that could overwhelm individual nodes, an increasing concern as Bitcoin's visibility and value grew.

The removal of "safe mode" alerts was also notable. Safe mode was a mechanism that could warn users when a potential problem was detected on the network. Its removal signaled a philosophical shift toward a more decentralized approach where no single entity should have the ability to issue warnings that could influence user behavior.

This release came just days after v0.3.18, and shortly before Satoshi's final known public communications. On December 12, Satoshi made his last post on the BitcoinTalk forum. By mid-January 2011, Satoshi had handed the source repository and network alert key to Gavin Andresen, and his last known email was sent to Martti Malmi on February 22, 2011, before disappearing entirely from public communication.

Bitcoin v0.3.19 stands as the last piece of software released by its pseudonymous creator, a fitting endpoint to a period of extraordinary innovation that fundamentally changed the world's relationship with money and digital trust.
