You did some research when choosing hosting, this was a well chosen one, 
right?  It seems like it would be a tremendous hassle to change, and 
we've had good luck with this one.  Cheaper will usually have some 
offsetting drawback in quality.

I wonder if that extra memory is just disk cache or something.

I take it you haven't received anything from that donor yet?  He seemed 
pretty certain he was going to send it, maybe more.  (if you get 
anything, we need to keep private for him the fact that we got a donation)
