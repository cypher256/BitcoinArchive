Dustin D. Trammell, a security researcher and cypherpunk using the handle "Druid," was among the very first people to download and run the Bitcoin software after Satoshi announced it on the Cryptography Mailing List on January 9, 2009.

In this email dated January 11, 2009, Trammell wrote to Satoshi reporting on his experience with the alpha release. He mentioned that he was reading through the Bitcoin whitepaper and referenced the timestamp server section, sharing a link to publictimestamp.org as a potentially related resource.

Trammell reported that he had been running the software and had seen two "Generated" messages, but the credit field showed 0.00 and his balance had not changed. He asked whether this was related to a maturity requirement for newly generated coins.

This email initiated one of the earliest known private correspondences with Satoshi Nakamoto and established Trammell as one of Bitcoin's very first users and miners. Trammell published the entirety of his email correspondence with Satoshi in November 2013.
