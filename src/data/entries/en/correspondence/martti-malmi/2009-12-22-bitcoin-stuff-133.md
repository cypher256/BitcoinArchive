I have registered the domain name bitcoinexchange.com and will start  
coding the service sometime soon as a nice leisure activity. I'm  
envisioning a simple Google-like interface with no registration and  
only two texts fields on the front page, where you insert the amount  
of money you wish to trade, and either your PayPal address to buy  
dollars or bitcoin address to buy bitcoins. On the next page you'll  
get a new bitcoin address for sending the coins or a check code for  
the PayPal transaction text.

PayPal is good for the beginning - it's simple and has no startup  
costs, but later on I might accept credit cards also.

Do you still need the maintenance account? It's ok if you do, but  
change the password to something else.
