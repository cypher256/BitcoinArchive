On February 21, 2024, during Day 13 of the COPA v. Craig Wright trial at the UK High Court of Justice, Martti Malmi testified via video link.

Malmi — Bitcoin's first administrator of bitcoin.org and Satoshi's earliest known collaborator — submitted a compilation of 260 emails with Satoshi Nakamoto as evidence. The emails totaled approximately 140,000 words and spanned from May 2009 to February 2011.

Malmi stated in court: "I communicated with Satoshi, who I believe to be a different person to Dr. Wright."

The same day, Adam Back also provided testimony, submitting the complete email chain between himself and Satoshi from August 2008.

Malmi subsequently published the full email archive on GitHub, explaining that he had withheld these conversations for years due to sensitive information (including links and passwords), but decided to make them public given the trial's significance.

The emails revealed intimate details of Bitcoin's earliest development: infrastructure decisions, website design, the first exchange proposals, energy consumption debates, anonymity discussions, and Satoshi's eventual withdrawal from the project.

*[The COPA v. Wright trial concluded on March 14, 2024, with Justice Mellor ruling that Craig Wright is not Satoshi Nakamoto.]*
