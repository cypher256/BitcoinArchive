I added the sourceforge tracker to bitcoin.sourceforge.net.  The 
complete selection of links is below if you want a different one.

I had it on bitcoin.org for a minute, but took it off.  It breaks the 
lock in SSL mode with a mixed content warning, "partially encrypted" and 
"contains unauthenticated content".  Anyway, do we really want 
sourceforge tracking everyone?  It's more privacy friendly without it.
