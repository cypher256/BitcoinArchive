On October 12, 2009, Martti Malmi sold 5,050 BTC to NewLibertyStandard for $5.02 via PayPal — the first known exchange of Bitcoin for fiat currency.

One week earlier, on October 5, 2009, NewLibertyStandard had published the first-ever Bitcoin exchange rate ($1 = 1,309.03 BTC) and launched a rudimentary exchange website. Malmi's motivation was to help bootstrap the market: someone had to be the first seller for a market to exist.

Malmi, a 20-year-old computer science student at the Helsinki University of Technology, had been Satoshi's closest collaborator since May 2009. He ported Bitcoin to Linux, built the `bitcoin.org` website, wrote the FAQ, and founded the BitcoinTalk forums. He was the first to sell — not for profit, but to prove that Bitcoin could function as a medium of exchange.

The transaction established Bitcoin's first real-world price: approximately $0.001 per BTC.

*[At 2025 prices exceeding $100,000 per BTC, those 5,050 bitcoins would be worth over $500 million.]*
