Bitcoin could be promoted to the users of virtual communities like  
World of Warcraft and Second Life, which both have millions of users.  
It would be great if not only peer-to-peer item traders, but also  
providers of some existing virtual services that already have a lot of  
customers, were to adopt the currency early on.

A programming question: What do you think about using the Boost's  
program_options to write settings like the transaction fee into a file  
bitcoin.config? Or is it better to save them in the database as it is  
now? Having a config file would make it easier to change the settings  
when running the program on a remote server with a console access only.
