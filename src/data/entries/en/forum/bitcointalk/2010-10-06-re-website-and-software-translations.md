poedit reorganised the file for some reason.  I re-ran update from sources and it put it back in the original order so it's fine now.  Did you run it on a drive where files aren't sorted alphabetically, like a FAT drive or USB flash drive?

Strings aren't added or changed very often.  It's months before enough changes build up.

I uploaded the changes.

This Windows build has the Russian translation in it:
