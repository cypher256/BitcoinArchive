Looks like an excellent opportunity to reach an important audience  
that doesn't follow Slashdot or Reddit. I'd recommend this job for  
Gavin or Bruce Wagner. Or maybe there can be two attendees. S3052 from  
the forum also seemed potentially competent.

Gavin, would you be interested in organizing this?

> Hello,

>
> At this top rated conference we deal with the key strategic   
> developments in the 'transaction industry' so not limited to   
> payments. The event is truly 'professional for professional', so   
> every presentation is screened on quality and relevance (no sales
