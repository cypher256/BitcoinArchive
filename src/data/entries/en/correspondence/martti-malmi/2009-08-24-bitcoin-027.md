I got it compile with MinGW + MSYS when I used wxPack instead of just  
wxWidgets. Maybe wxAdditions was required. The bitcoin.exe filesize  
was 52MB though, I should see how that can be fixed.

Next I'm going to implement the "minimize to tray" feature and the  
option to autostart Bitcoin with Windows, so the number of nodes  
online would stay higher. After that I could see if I can do a Linux  
port or the command line interface needed for web app frameworks.

Drop by at #bitcoin-dev on FreeNode some time if you use IRC.

And again, thanks for the great work you've done with Bitcoin.
