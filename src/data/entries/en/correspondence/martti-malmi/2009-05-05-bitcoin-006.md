Quoting Satoshi Nakamoto <satoshin@gmx.com>:

Ok. Could you set the project MySQL database passwords so that I can  
set up a CMS on the site? I was thinking about WordPress, as it seems  
simple and well maintained. I need a password for the read/write  
account and one database (or the database admin pass to create it  
myself). This can be done somewhere in the project admin pages, I think.

Ok, that's good to know.

Well, I guess that's true after all.
