b-money was announced on the cypherpunks mailing list in 1998. Here's the archived post: https://cypherpunks.venona.com/date/1998/11/msg00941.html

There are some discussions of it at https://cypherpunks.venona.com/date/1998/12/msg00194.html.

Thanks for letting me know about your paper. I'll take a look at it and let you know if I have any comments or questions.
