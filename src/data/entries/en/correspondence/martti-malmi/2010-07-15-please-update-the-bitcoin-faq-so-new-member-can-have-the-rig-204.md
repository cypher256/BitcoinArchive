Hi,

In the FAQ of bitcoin.org <http://bitcoin.org> the backing up of the
wallet had old instructions, right?  Should it just be to back up
wallat.dat instead of the entire folder???  See below.


"How do I backup my wallet?

Your data is stored in the directory ''%appdata%\Bitcoin'', which is
typically:

  Windows XP:
    C:\Documents and Settings\username\Application Data\Bitcoin
  Windows Vista:
    C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Bitcoin

It’s recommended that you stop Bitcoin before backing it up to make sure
the backup will be correct."
