Quoting Satoshi Nakamoto <satoshin@gmx.com>:

The built-in Wordpress comes with ads, and new plugins and themes need  
to be installed by the Sourceforge staff, so I installed Wordpress at  
http://bitcoin.sourceforge.net/. The admin page is at .../wp-admin/,  
with admin/Wubreches3eS as login. If there's something to add or  
change, feel free to.

The current layout is just a quickly applied free theme, but I'll see  
if I can do something more visual myself.

The MediaWiki might be quite useful for maintaining the FAQ, which  
could be retrieved from there to the main site somehow. The wiki says  
I need to be an editor or admin to create a new page, which is funny,  
because  
https://apps.sourceforge.net/mediawiki/bitcoin/index.php?title=Special:ListGroupRights says that users can create  
pages.
