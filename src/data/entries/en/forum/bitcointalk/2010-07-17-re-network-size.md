[Quote from: NewLibertyStandard on July 17, 2010, 10:22:09 PM](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=419.msg3817#msg3817)Version 0.3 was supposed to reduce the number of outgoing connections on non-port forwarded clients from 15 to 8, but I don't think it really happened. I'm not positive if this is the case. Correct me if I'm wrong.
In 0.3.0, the change to 8 only ended up in the Windows version, the other versions still had 15.

Please upgrade to 0.3.2, it's available now.
