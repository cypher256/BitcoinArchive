On February 5, 2010, NewLibertyStandard proposed on the BitcoinTalk forum:

"I propose that we adopt the Thai baht currency symbol, ฿, as the official bitcoin currency symbol and BTC as the official bitcoin three letter currency code."

The proposal sparked discussion among early community members, with some concerned that sharing the baht symbol (฿) could cause confusion with the Thai currency.

Later, on November 1, 2010, forum user "bitboy" designed what became the iconic Bitcoin logo: the ฿ rendered in white on an orange circle, rotated 14 degrees clockwise.

*[Both "BTC" and the ฿ symbol remain in universal use today. The currency code "XBT" was later proposed as an ISO 4217-compliant alternative (since "BT" is Bhutan's country code), but "BTC" remains far more widely recognized.]*
