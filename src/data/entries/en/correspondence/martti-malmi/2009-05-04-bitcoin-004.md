Oh, that's not me but another guy who wanted to help. I've seen him on  
the Freedomain Radio forum. My name is Martti Malmi and my Sourceforge  
account is sirius-m. No problem!

Thanks for your answered questions, I'll add them to the faq. Here's  
what I've done so far:

**** Bitcoin FAQ ****

General Questions

1 What is bitcoin?

Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer network based anonymous digital
currency. Peer-to-peer (P2P) means that there is no central
authority to issue new money or to keep track of the
transactions. Instead, those tasks are managed collectively by
the nodes of the network. Anonymity means that the real world
identity of the parties of a transaction can be kept hidden from
the public or even from the parties themselves.

2 How does bitcoin work?

Bitcoin utilizes public/private key cryptography. When a coin is
transfered from user A to user B, A adds B's public key to the
coin and signs it with his own private key. Now B owns the coin
and can transfer it further. To prevent A from transfering the
already used coin to another user C, a public list of all the
previous transactions is collectively maintained by the network
of bitcoin nodes, and before each transaction the coin's
unusedness will be checked.

For details, see chapter Advanced Questions.

3 What is bitcoin's value backed by?

Bitcoin is valued for the things it can be exchanged to, just
like all the traditional paper currencies are.

When the first user publicly announces that he will make a pizza
for anyone who gives him a hundred bitcoins, then he can use
bitcoins as payment to some extent - as much as people want pizza
and trust his announcement. A pizza-eating hairdresser who trusts
him as a friend might then announce that she starts accepting
bitcoins as payment for fancy haircuts, and the value of the
bitcoin would be higher - now you could buy pizzas and haircuts
with them. When bitcoins have become accepted widely enough, he
could retire from his pizza business and still be able to use his
bitcoin-savings.

4 How are new bitcoins created?

New coins are generated by a network node each time it finds the
solution to a certain calculational problem. In the first 4 years
of the bitcoin network, amount X of coins will be created. The
amount is halved each 4 years, so it will be X/2 after 4 years,
X/4 after 8 years and so on. Thus the total number of coins will
approach 2X.

5 Is bitcoin safe?

Yes, as long as you make backups of your coin keys, protect them
with strong passwords and keep keyloggers away from your
computer. If you lose your key or if some unknown attacker
manages to unlock it, there's no way to get your coins back. If
you have a large amount of coins, it is recommended to distribute
them under several keys. You propably wouldn't either keep all
your dollars or euros as paper in a single wallet and leave it
unguarded.

6 Why should I use bitcoin?

• Transfer money easily through the internet, without having to
   trust third parties.

• Third parties can't prevent or control your transactions.

• Be safe from the unfair monetary policies of the monopolistic
   central banks and the other risks of centralized power over a
   money supply. The limited inflation of the bitcoin system's
   money supply is distributed evenly (by CPU power) throughout
   the network, not monopolized to a banking elite.

• Bitcoin's value is likely to increase as the growth of the
   bitcoin economy exceeds the inflation rate - consider bitcoin
   an investment and start running a node today!

7 Where can I get bitcoins?

Find a bitcoin owner and sell her something - MMORPG equipement,
IT support, lawn mowing, dollars or whatever you can trade with
her. You can also generate new bitcoins for yourself by running a
bitcoin network node.
