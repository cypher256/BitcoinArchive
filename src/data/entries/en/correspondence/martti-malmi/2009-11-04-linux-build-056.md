Enabling the proxy setting and restarting Bitcoin I got the first  
connections in less than a minute and ultimately even 8 connections. I  
wonder if they're all really through TOR. Netstat shows only 2  
connections to localhost:9050 and 7 connections from local port 8333  
to elsewhere. (Some of the shown connections may be already  
disconnected ones.) For some reason there's no debug.log in the folder  
where I'm running it.

The wiki page sounds like a good and quickly applicable solution. I  
could keep my ip updated there and we could ask others to do the same.  
When the Linux build works, it's easier to set up nodes on servers  
that are online most of the time and have a static IP. A static ip  
list shipped with Bitcoin and a peer exchange protocol would be cool.  
That way there'd be no need for an IRC server.

Ok. I didn't get it linked on the first attempt, but I didn't look  
further into the dependencies yet.
