It's already an improvement, and like you say, there must be better 
themes to choose from.

It would be good to make the download link go directly to the download area:
https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=244765

I haven't found any way to gain admin control over the mediawiki 
feature.  It thinks I'm a different S_nakamoto from the one that has 
admin access:
     User list
     * S nakamoto  <- it thinks I'm this one
     * S nakamoto ‎(admin, editor)
     * Sirius-m

I tried deleting and re-enabling the feature, no help.  Oh well.
