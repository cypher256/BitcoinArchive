I think our problem may be that we have forum notifications on, like
e-mail you when you receive a PM, but we don't have e-mail verification
of new accounts.  Can someone put someone else's e-mail address without
verifying it, then have stuff sent there?  We need to stop that right
away before it gets used for something bad.  Either disallow all
notification, or make sure e-mail addresses are verified.

I'm more inclined to disallow notifications or anything where the forum
sends you e-mail.  I kinda like not requiring e-mail verification.  But
if that's the only way to make sure we don't send e-mails to un-verified
addresses, then we could do that.

If we request to get off of PBL, we'd better make sure we've got the
problem secured first.

I changed Registration->settings->registration of new members to "Member
Activation".  I assume that means it e-mail verifies.
"Member Activation
When this option is enabled any members registering to the forum will
have a activation link emailed to them which they must click before they
can become full members"

I think that's the only way to make sure the forum can't be used to send
to other people's e-mail addresses and potentially use it to spam.
