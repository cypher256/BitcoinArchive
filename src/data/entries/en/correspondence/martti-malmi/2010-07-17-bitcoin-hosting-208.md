Rackspace has very good support, good backend, good connections and  
nicely scaling cloud based virtual servers. I got this offer from  
Thufir:

Hi Sirius,

Check out www.citrusdesignstudio.com. You will see through the portfolio that
I am a real business with many clients.

That is my business that I provide managed hosting through.
I also do unmanaged VPSes.

Normally I would charge $15/mo for 512MB.
I will do it for $10/mo for you.

To see my pricing, go to www.linnode.com. I match everything they have except
their great panel -- you have to email or call my people.

I provide VPS services normally for 3/4ths the posted cost on linnode.com.
(Rackspace is even more expensive.)

I will do it for 1/2 of linnode's price for you.

It scales linerally just like linnodes, so for 2048 MB of memory, I would
charge $40, etc.

Later!

That would be worth considering, if they have good datacenters and  
connections. $10 / month is about $20 less than what Rackspace costs.  
On the other hand, Rackspace prices are no problem if the donation is  
to arrive.
