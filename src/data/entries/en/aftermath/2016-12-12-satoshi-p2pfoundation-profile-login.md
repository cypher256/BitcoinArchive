In December 2016, members of the Bitcoin community noticed that Satoshi Nakamoto's profile on the P2P Foundation social network showed recent login activity. The P2P Foundation was the platform where Satoshi had originally posted a link to the Bitcoin white paper on February 11, 2009, and where the "I am not Dorian Nakamoto" message had appeared on March 7, 2014.

The login activity was visible through the platform's user interface, which displayed when a member had last been active. The observation prompted widespread discussion in Bitcoin forums and on social media, with community members debating whether the login represented genuine activity by Satoshi or indicated that the account had been accessed by an unauthorized party.

No new posts or messages were made from the account at this time. The P2P Foundation platform, built on the Ning social network, did not offer two-factor authentication and used relatively basic security measures, making it plausible that the account could have been compromised.

The incident highlighted the ongoing fascination with any potential sign of activity from Bitcoin's pseudonymous creator. Since Satoshi's last confirmed email in April 2011, every instance of apparent activity on accounts associated with the Satoshi Nakamoto identity has drawn intense scrutiny from the community.
