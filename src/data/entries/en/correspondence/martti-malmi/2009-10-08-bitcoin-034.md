I made a Windows installer for the latest version of Bitcoin, which  
includes the autostart and minimize to tray features. The installer  
makes a start menu shortcut and a startup registry entry. I first  
implemented the autostart with a shortcut to the startup folder, but I  
found out that it doesn't always work by default and ended up doing it  
with a registry entry. The registry entry is removed by the  
uninstaller and can be also disabled from the options menu, so I don't  
think it's such a big menace to the user after all.

I made the installer with NSIS, and the nsi script can be found in the SVN.

Could you add the installer to the SF download page? Here's the file:

There are some new users registered to the bitcoin.sf.net site. One of  
them just announced that he's trading Bitcoins for dollars. Here's his  
site: http://newlibertystandard.wetpaint.com/. Making an exchange  
service first seemed a bit premature for the time being, but on the  
other hand it's good that people show interest towards the project,  
and this might attract even more interested people (and hopefully more  
developers). I just sent the guy an email.
