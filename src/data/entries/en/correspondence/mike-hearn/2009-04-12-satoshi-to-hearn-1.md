Mike Hearn, a software engineer at Google, reached out to Satoshi in early 2009 after discovering Bitcoin. Their correspondence continued over the following years and provides unique insight into Satoshi's vision for Bitcoin's development.

In their exchanges, Satoshi discussed various technical aspects of Bitcoin including simplified payment verification (SPV), the future of the block chain, and his thoughts on how the network would evolve as it grew.

Satoshi told Hearn: "I've been meaning to write a description of how I envision the future scaling of Bitcoin."
