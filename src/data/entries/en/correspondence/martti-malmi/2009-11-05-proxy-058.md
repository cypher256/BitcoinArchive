debug.log moved to the data directory "%appdata%/bitcoin/debug.log"

7 inbound and 2 outbound sounds about as expected.

My last SVN commit included an overhaul of the code that selects the 
order of addresses to connect to, trying them in the order of most 
recently seen online, so it should get connected in a more reasonable 
amount of time if IRC is unavailable.  IRC is really only needed to seed 
the first connection, but we've been using it as a crutch to get 
connected faster.

That would be great.  It's only TOR users that need it, so in the 
instructions saying "bitcoin -proxy=127.0.0.1:9050 -addnode=<someip>", 
someip could be an actual static IP, with the wiki free-for-all 
add-your-ip list nearby or a link to it.  There should be a link to that optional step, add your IP to this list now that you can accept incoming 
if you're static.

Do you think anonymous people are looking to be completely stealth, as 
in never connect once without TOR so nobody knows they use bitcoin, or 
just want to switch to TOR before doing any transactions?  It's just if 
you want to be completely stealth that you'd have to go through the 
-proxy -addnode manual seeding.  It would be very easy to fumble that 
up; if you run bitcoin normally to begin with it immediately 
automatically starts connecting.
