[Quote from: BitLex on July 25, 2010, 08:45:38 PM](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=461.msg5753#msg5753)i got some problems here too trying to get this run on PHP.
so far i had no luck, neither the wiki-sample (jsonRPCClient trying to fopen([http://username:password@localhost:8332/](http://username:password@localhost:8332/))), nor my curl-sample (using setopt CURLOPT_HTTPAUTH, CURLAUTH_BASIC) seem to work.
That's strange, didn't someone just say that was supposed to work?  (what library was he using?)  Post if you figure out what wrong.

I hope it's not going to put up this much of a fight for all PHP users.

Looks like we've got the Fortran scenario already.
