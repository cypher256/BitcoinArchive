Harold Thomas Finney II was born on May 4, 1956, in Coalinga, California, and grew up in Arcadia, California. He graduated with honors from Arcadia High School in 1974 and earned a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in 1979.

**Cryptography and PGP:**
In 1991, Finney began volunteering for Phil Zimmermann's Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) project, writing code for free. He became the lead developer and main author of PGP 2.0, building the core cryptographic libraries. When Zimmermann founded PGP Inc. in 1996, Finney was hired as one of the first employees (the company later became part of Symantec through acquisitions).

**Extropianism and Cryonics:**
Finney was an active participant in the Extropy Institute's discussions on cryonics, life extension, space colonization, nanotechnology, and artificial intelligence. He became interested in cryonics during his freshman year at Caltech. On October 15, 1992, he and his wife Fran signed their Alcor cryonics membership paperwork in Riverside, California. He remained an Alcor member for over 20 years.

**Reusable Proof-of-Work:**
In 2004, Finney created the first Reusable Proof-of-Work (RPOW) system — a precursor concept to Bitcoin's proof-of-work mechanism. He was deeply engaged with the cypherpunk movement's goal of creating digital cash.

**Bitcoin:**
On January 9, 2009, Finney downloaded Bitcoin v0.1 on its release day and became the first person other than Satoshi Nakamoto to run a Bitcoin node. He began mining around Block 70. On January 11, 2009, he tweeted "Running bitcoin" — the first public mention of running the software. On January 12, 2009, he received 10 BTC from Satoshi in Block 170 — the first person-to-person Bitcoin transaction in history.

**ALS and Final Years:**
In August 2009, Finney was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Despite progressive paralysis, he continued writing code for Bitcoin — eventually using eye-tracking software to communicate and program. He retired from PGP Corporation (Symantec) in early 2011. On March 19, 2013, he published "Bitcoin and Me" on BitcoinTalk, describing his experience as Bitcoin's first user.

Hal Finney died on August 28, 2014, at 8:50 AM in Scottsdale, Arizona. He was cryopreserved by Alcor Life Extension Foundation as their 128th patient (member A-1436). He is survived by his wife Fran, son Jason, and daughter Erin.
