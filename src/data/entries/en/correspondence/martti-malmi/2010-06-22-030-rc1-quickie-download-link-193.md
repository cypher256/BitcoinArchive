If bandwidth is a problem, delete my link in the "0.3 almost ready" 
thread.  I just don't want to upload it to sourceforge for a quickie 
share for a day or two, possibly taking it down immediately if there's a 
bug.  Sourceforge has a policy of not allowing removal of files once 
they're added, and it's a pain to upload to.  I'll delete the file once 
the release is ready.

BTW, it's looking like I may be able to get us some money soon to cover 
web host costs, back your exchange service, etc, in the form of cash in 
the mail.  Can you receive it and act as the project's treasurer?
