The easy solution I took was to look at the wxWidgets source code and 
see how they did it.  They just mapped it to wxMutex on non-MSW, which 
does have TryEnter, so that mapped in perfectly.

I checked in all my backlog of changes to SVN, including the overhaul of 
CCriticalSection in util.h and OpenSSL's mutex callback in util.cpp to 
do everything with wxWidgets when not on Windows.

If we get it working on Linux, I'll run my test suite against it here 
off-network first, then we can give an unreleased build to 
LibertyStandard to test for a while before going public.
