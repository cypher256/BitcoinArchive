On March 14, 2024, Justice Mellor of the UK High Court delivered a landmark ruling in the case of COPA (Crypto Open Patent Alliance) v. Craig Steven Wright. The court found:

1. Dr. Wright is not the author of the Bitcoin White Paper.
2. Dr. Wright is not the person who adopted or operated under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto in the period 2008 to 2011.
3. Dr. Wright is not the person who created the Bitcoin System.
4. Dr. Wright did not author the initial versions of the Bitcoin software.

The judge concluded that the evidence overwhelmingly showed Dr. Wright had engaged in deliberate and extensive forgery of documents to support his false claim of being Satoshi Nakamoto.
