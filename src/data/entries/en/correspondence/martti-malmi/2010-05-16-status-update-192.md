I've also been busy with other things for the last month and a half.  I 
just now downloaded my e-mail since the beginning of April.  I mostly 
have things sorted and should be back to Bitcoin shortly.  Glad that 
you've been handling things in my absence.  Congrats on your first 
transaction!

As I recall, the code was nearly ready for a 0.3 release.  I think all 
it needed was a little testing time and to install the new icon xpm.

The JSON API functions are complete.  I wanted to take another fresh 
look at them in case I think of any better function names before 
committing.  I ought to write some sample code showing the proper way to 
use them, particularly with polling for received transactions.  When I 
left off, I was thinking about bolting a payment mechanism onto a free 
upload server software as an example.  It would make sense to actually 
build one practical application with the API before releasing it.  You 
don't realise the problems with an API until you actually try to use it.
