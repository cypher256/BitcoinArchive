I created a forum on Zetaboards, InvisionFree's new site that they're 
migrating to.

http://s1.zetaboards.com/Bitcoin/index/

I made an admin account you can use to upgrade your own account to admin:
u: admin
pw: B98VzUUA

BTW, the admin pages have a huge blank space at the top, you have to 
scroll down.

It doesn't support SSL, but none of them do.  I replaced the ugly 
default orange and blue theme with the Frostee theme, which was the only 
decent looking theme I could find after extensive searching.  Searching 
for themes is futile, there are thousands of rubbish themes.  It turns 
out the solution is to look at button sets instead 
(http://resources.zetaboards.com/forum/1000328/)

I only created two subforums to begin with.  I'll create new ones as the 
need arises.  I like to start with a flat namespace until there's enough 
items to justify subsections.  Technical Support makes sense as a 
separate section to get that stuff out of the main spotlight so our 
dirty laundry isn't in everyone's face, and to make people feel more 
free to report bugs there.  Mostly only devs and people checking on a 
bug need read the Technical Support section.
