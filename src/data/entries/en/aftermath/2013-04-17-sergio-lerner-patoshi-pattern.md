*From Bitslog, April 17, 2013:*

Sergio Demian Lerner analyzed blocks 0 through 36,288 (January 1, 2009 to January 25, 2010) by tracking the ExtraNonce fields in the coinbase transaction. He identified a distinctive pattern in the nonce values that distinguished one dominant miner's blocks from all others.

**Key findings:**

A single entity mined approximately 1,148,800 BTC (~22,000 blocks) during 2009-2010 using a single mining rig.

63% of all awarded bitcoins (1,148,800 of 1,814,400 BTC) had never been spent, corresponding to this identified mining entity.

At 2013 prices, this represented approximately $100 million in value.

The entity — dubbed "Patoshi" by Lerner — reduced his hashrate in several steps during the first year and likely turned off his miner for five-minute intervals each time he mined a new block, to foster healthy competition and avoid dominating all new block production.

"I can't assure with 100% certainty that all the black dots are owned by Satoshi, but almost all are owned by a single entity."

*[The term "Patoshi" was coined by Lerner to refer to this prominent early miner, widely (but not conclusively) believed to be Satoshi Nakamoto. Notably, none of the Patoshi coins have ever been moved or spent, consistent with Satoshi's apparent decision to never profit from his creation. Lerner continued refining his analysis in follow-up posts in 2019 and 2020, further confirming the pattern's validity.]*
