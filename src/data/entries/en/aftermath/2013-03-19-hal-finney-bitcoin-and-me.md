On March 19, 2013, Hal Finney posted "Bitcoin and Me (Hal Finney)" on the BitcoinTalk forum. Written while essentially paralyzed by ALS, using a commercial eye-tracking system to operate his computer and a speech synthesizer for his voice, it remains the definitive first-person account of Bitcoin's earliest days.

**On being Bitcoin's first user:**
> "I think I was the first person besides Satoshi to run bitcoin. I mined block 70-something, and I was the recipient of the first bitcoin transaction, when Satoshi sent ten coins to me as a test."

**On his background:**
Finney described working on early PGP versions with Phil Zimmermann and his involvement with the Cypherpunks movement, including creating "the first anonymous crypto-based remailer." He had corresponded with Wei Dai and Nick Szabo about digital currency concepts.

**On Bitcoin's initial reception:**
When Satoshi announced Bitcoin on the cryptography mailing list, the reception was "rather skeptical at best." Finney found it compelling and downloaded it immediately upon release.

**On Satoshi's character:**
Finney characterized Satoshi as "a young man of Japanese ancestry who was very smart and sincere," noting his recognition of such brilliance from knowing many talented people throughout his career.

**On his ALS diagnosis (August 2009):**
> "ALS is a disease that kills motor neurons, which carry signals from the brain to the muscles. It causes first weakness, then gradually increasing paralysis."
>
> "My body began to fail. I slurred my speech, lost strength in my hands."

**On his condition at the time of writing:**
> "Today, I am essentially paralyzed. I am fed through a tube, and my breathing is assisted through another tube."
>
> "It's been an adjustment, but my life is not too bad... I still love programming and it gives me goals."

**On continuing to program:**
> "I recently discovered that I can even write code. It's very slow, probably 50 times slower than I was before."

He described creating an Arduino interface for his wheelchair and continuing to work on Bitcoin wallet security features.

**On his legacy:**
Finney expressed comfort with his bitcoins' inheritance plan through his tech-savvy children. He died on August 28, 2014, seventeen months after writing this post.
