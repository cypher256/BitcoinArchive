> Interesting, so how is the balance between purchases of coins and cash going?

About +1000€ (plus the $1000) and -40000 BTC since when I started. I  
should have set the initial BTC price higher, it was only 1€ / 1000  
BTC in the beginning.

I had to build it myself. It had the same problem that has been  
reported on the forums: /usr/lib/libstdc++.so.6: version  
`GLIBCXX_3.4.11' not found.
