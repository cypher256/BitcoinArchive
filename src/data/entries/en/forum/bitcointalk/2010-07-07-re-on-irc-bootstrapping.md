Everybody needs to connect to the same IRC server and channel so they can find each other.

[Quote from: Vasiliev on June 25, 2010, 11:50:15 PM](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=84.msg1785#msg1785)You may want to leave Freenode in as a fallback server -- if his server doesn't work, use Freenode's.
It might not be good if we suddenly rushed freenode with a ton of users all at once.

The fallback is our own seed system. 

irc.lfnet.org is pretty old and has impressive uptime.  I think it's going to be fine.

We could take IRC out at some point if we want, but I'd rather ease into it and just test our own seed system as a backup for now, and I really like the complementary redundant attributes of the two different systems.
