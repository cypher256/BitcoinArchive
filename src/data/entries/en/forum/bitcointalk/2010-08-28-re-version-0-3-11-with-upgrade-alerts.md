What OS?  I ran the Windows and 64-bit Linux version and checked the about dialog.

The Mac version is still 0.3.10.1.

That way, only the function in question would be optimized, and if the user doesn't specify -4way, everything else should be ok.
I updated the first post to be more specific.  Only the -4way code is compiled this way.
