Thanks for clearing that up.  I read the link someone posted about AMD making that change around 2007, but I didn't know what the story was for Intel.

There's no hope for Core/Core2 then.  They only have half the SSE2 hardware.

Strange that Intel has 3 128bit units, but AMD with 2 128bit units is the faster one.
