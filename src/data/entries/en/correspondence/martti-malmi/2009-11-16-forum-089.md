I think the biggest advantage is having a single site so you don't  
need a separate account for the wiki and the forum, and the  
functionalities are also nicely integrated with the main site itself.  
Also being ad-free is a plus.

How about Drupal's forum functionality? Address:  
https://174.143.149.98/drupal/. The CMS in general looks better and  
simpler than TikiWiki. If the forum's not good enough, then we can of  
course use a specialized forum software like phpBB.

Otherwise fine, but the ads and the lack of SSL are a minus.
