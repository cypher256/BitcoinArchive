The first time I tried it on Windows, the initial download took a few  
minutes to start, even though it got many connections quickly. I tried  
again twice, and didn't have the same problem again. I don't know  
whether it's related to your latest update or not.

On Ubuntu it worked fine.

Well actually it is, but it's not too bad. Time is a matter of arrangement.
