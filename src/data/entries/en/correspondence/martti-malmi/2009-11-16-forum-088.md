What do you see as the benefits of switching the wiki?
Some I can think of:
  SSL
  get away from sourceforge's unreliable hosting
  everything not logged by sourceforge

The forum feature is about as weak as bitweaver.  We need a full blown 
forum software for that.

My priority right now is to get a forum going, either phpBB or similar. 
  What do you think of the zetaboards option?  Should we go ahead with that?
