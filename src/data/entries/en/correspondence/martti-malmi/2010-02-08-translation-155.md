Does Drupal have any special multi-language support, or do you just 
create copies of pages by hand?

BlueSky offered to do translation on the forum.  If you create a 
www.bitcoin.org/zh/ copy of the site and give him an account with just 
the ability to create new pages and edit text, he'll probably translate 
the site into Chinese for you and maybe maintain it.
