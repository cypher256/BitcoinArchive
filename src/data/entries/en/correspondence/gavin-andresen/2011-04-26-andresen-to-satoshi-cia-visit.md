In his reply to Satoshi's "alert key" email, Gavin Andresen addressed several points. He acknowledged reading a Forbes article and agreed that the "pirate currency" framing was problematic. He accepted Satoshi's suggestion to give more credit to other developer contributors.

Andresen also accepted responsibility for the alert key, though he expressed concern about identifying trustworthy recipients to share it with.

Then, Andresen disclosed something significant -- he had been contacted by In-Q-Tel (IQT), a US government-funded strategic investment company that supports the CIA and other intelligence agencies. IQT had invited him to present Bitcoin at their annual conference on emerging technologies for US intelligence agencies. Andresen explained his reasoning for accepting the invitation:

> I hope that by talking directly to "them" and, more importantly, listening to their questions/concerns, they will think of Bitcoin the way I do -- as a just-plain-better, more efficient, less-subject-to-political-whims money. Not as an all-powerful black-market tool that will be used by anarchists to overthrow The System.

Andresen committed to transparency about the engagement, saying he would publicly announce the visit.

Satoshi never replied to this message and was never heard from again.

The timing of Satoshi's disappearance following this disclosure has fueled years of speculation. Some believe Satoshi's departure was motivated by concern over government attention to Bitcoin. Others note that Satoshi had already been gradually withdrawing for months and that the April 26 email's tone -- "I've moved on to other things" -- suggests the departure was planned regardless of Andresen's CIA disclosure.

Andresen followed through on his promise and presented at CIA headquarters on June 14, 2011.
