Does it still do it if you didn't do getinfo?

You could comment out the CreateThreads listed below, then re-enable 
them one at a time until it does it again.  Then we would know which 
thread the problem is in.

net.cpp, under // Start threads
     CreateThread(ThreadIRCSeed, NULL)
     CreateThread(ThreadSocketHandler, NULL, true)
     CreateThread(ThreadOpenConnections, NULL)
     CreateThread(ThreadMessageHandler, NULL)

init.cpp:
     CreateThread(ThreadRPCServer, NULL);
