I'm working on getting version 0.3 released as soon as I can.  Just a last few things left to do.  It's been a long time since 0.2 and we need to get a prebuilt bitcoind with command line and JSON-RPC available.  This time we'll have both 32-bit and 64-bit linux binaries, and Laszlo is going to build a Mac OSX release.  Plus, we'll include the German, Dutch and Italian translations by DataWraith, Xunie and Joozero (thanks you guys!).
