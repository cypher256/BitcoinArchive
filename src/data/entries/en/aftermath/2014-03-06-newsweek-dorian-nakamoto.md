On March 6, 2014, Newsweek published a cover story titled "The Face Behind Bitcoin" by journalist Leah McGrath Goodman, claiming to have identified Bitcoin's creator. The article pointed to Dorian Prentice Satoshi Nakamoto, a 64-year-old Japanese-American physicist and systems engineer living in Temple City, California.

Goodman based her identification largely on the fact that Dorian's birth name was "Satoshi Nakamoto," that he had a background in engineering and classified defense work, and a quote she attributed to him during a brief doorstep interview: "I am no longer involved in that and I cannot discuss it."

The article sparked a media frenzy. Reporters and photographers descended on Dorian Nakamoto's home, chasing the bewildered retiree through the streets of Temple City. The incident drew widespread criticism of Newsweek's journalistic approach, particularly the publication of Dorian's home address and photograph.

Dorian Nakamoto firmly and repeatedly denied any involvement with Bitcoin. He stated he had misunderstood the reporter's question and thought she was asking about his previous classified engineering work. He retained a lawyer and gave a detailed interview to the Associated Press reaffirming his denial.

The following day, on March 7, 2014, a message appeared on Satoshi Nakamoto's P2P Foundation account stating simply: "I am not Dorian Nakamoto." The authenticity of this post remains debated, as Satoshi's P2P Foundation account may have been compromised.

The Bitcoin community rallied behind Dorian, raising over 67 BTC in donations for him. The incident became a cautionary tale about irresponsible reporting on Satoshi's identity and the consequences for innocent individuals caught in the speculation.
