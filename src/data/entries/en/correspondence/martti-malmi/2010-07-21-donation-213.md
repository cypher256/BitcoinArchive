That's great!  I'll let him know it was received and thank him.

It might be a long time before we get another donation like that, we 
should save a lot of it.

Spend what you need on hosting.  Email me a simple accounting when you 
take out money for expenses, like:
    -$60 rackspace monthly
   $2540 balance

$100-200 is chump change if they're a serious company, it would only 
make us sound small.

What they need most is confidence they can convert it to fiat currency. 
  That VOIP company essentially said so in a recent post.  The best 
thing we can do is make sure there's cash available to cash out and 
support and steady the conversion rate.

The money is leveraged better that way too.  Theoretically, imagine 10 
businesses have their eye on a $100 bill being offered for bitcoins, but 
don't actually cash out because they know it's there if they need it. 
That one $100 bill allowed 10 different people to act like their 5000 
bitcoins were equivalent to $100.

I think we should allocate $1000 at this point to your exchange.
