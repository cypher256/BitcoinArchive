Maybe the current difficulty of buying LR is already the limit of how 
easy it can get in that direction.

Every conventional payment method has refutability as their way to cope 
with their lack of passwords and crypto.  The system is wide open to 
copying plaintext credit card numbers and account numbers, and they deal 
with it by reversing the transaction after the fact.  The system works 
for physical goods that have to be delivered somewhere, and services 
which can't be resold.  It's a problem when it interfaces with precious 
metals and currency conversion.

The first step of being easy in one direction, bitcoin->LR or anything 
of established value, goes a long way.  Even those who don't use the 
conversion still benefit from knowing that they could.  Trading bitcoin 
becomes an easier way to trade the ability to claim LR, similar to how 
paper money was once the right to claim gold.  Nobody has to ever 
actually claim the LR to get the benefit of having the option that they 
could if they wanted to.

A lot of times you just need a minuscule amount of online currency.  The 
hassle of buying the other online currencies is too much for buying a 
small amount.  The ease of getting a small amount of bitcoin may help 
bootstrap an ecosystem of sellers of micropayment sized online goods 
selling to that market.  If the sellers can get LR for bitcoins, they're 
happy, and that may be subsidized at first by investors who want to buy 
bc in large lots.

The main thing holding online currencies back is the lack of an easy way 
to get a small amount of currency.  Bitcoin opens that up.  It'll be the 
only online currency that's both easy to cash out and easy to get a 
small amount.  It'll just be the usual harder difficulty to buy a large 
amount.
