IS_LIVE option was indeed set to false, but it only affects the  
visibility of error messages to user. I've noticed the site being slow  
at times, sometimes taking up to 30 seconds to load. I think it's  
related to the Sourceforge hosting. Bitweaver should be among the  
lightest PHP CMS'es, but I can check out if there are any issues to it.

Off the topic, do you think that we could use Boost's thread and  
socket libraries instead of the Windows-specific ones? Are there other  
windows-only-functions used in the code?
