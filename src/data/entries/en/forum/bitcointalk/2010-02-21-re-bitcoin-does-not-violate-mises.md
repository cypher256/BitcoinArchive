Bitcoin is an implementation of Wei Dai's b-money proposal http://www.weidai.com/bmoney.txt on Cypherpunks http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypherpunks in 1998 and Nick Szabo's Bitgold proposal http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2005/12/bit-gold.html

The timing is strange, just as the first of the 4 main central banks started printing money in fall 2008.
