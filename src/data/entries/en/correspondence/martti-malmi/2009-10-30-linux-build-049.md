I fixed some non-portable stuff I came across:
QueryPerformanceCounter
%I64d in printf format strings
Sleep
CheckDiskSpace

If there's any other unportable stuff you know of I should fix, let me know.

I think I'll move debug.log and db.log into the same directory as the 
data files (%appdata%\Bitcoin), rather than whatever the current 
directory happens to be.
