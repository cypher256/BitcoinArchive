Thanks, that worked, I got File Manager installed with SSH.  I also 
uploaded a few themes into Drupal.  I haven't thoroughly gone through 
all the available themes yet.

Looked around at CMSes, Drupal and Joomla are popular.  Consensus is 
Joomla has a better selection of themes and is easier to learn, though 
Drupal may be more intuitive for programmers and customization.  Joomla 
better for CMS, Drupal better for blogs.  Drupal's URLs are search 
engine friendly, Joomla not.

Both have SMF bridge modules available.  For future reference, Drupal's 
is named "SMFforum Integration".
