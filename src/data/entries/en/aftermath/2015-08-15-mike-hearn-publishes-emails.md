In August 2015, Mike Hearn published his complete email correspondence with Satoshi Nakamoto on his personal website. The emails span from early 2009 to April 2011 and cover topics including:

- How Satoshi envisioned Bitcoin scaling in the future
- The role of simplified payment verification (SPV)
- How mining would evolve from CPUs to specialized hardware
- Satoshi's thoughts on the alert system
- The transition of project leadership

These emails are among the most important primary sources for understanding Satoshi's long-term vision for Bitcoin.
