Good news: I received the donation of $3600. At least the hosting  
costs are no problem anymore.

What do you think of the idea to offer rewards of $100-200 to the  
first 5-10 established companies that start accepting Bitcoin? We'd  
also assign them a dedicated support person to help with integration.  
I have companies like prq.se, ipredator.se, relakks.com or  
perfect-privacy.com in mind. We could also make the offer public.
