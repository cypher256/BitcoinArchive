I made an #ifdef to replace QueryPerformanceCounter with Linux's  
gettimeofday in util.h. Some Unicode/ANSI errors were resolved without  
code changes when I updated to wxWidgets 2.9. The only compile error  
I'm getting in Linux at the moment is from heapchk() in util.h.

> I fixed some non-portable stuff I came across:
> QueryPerformanceCounter
> %I64d in printf format strings
> Sleep
> CheckDiskSpace

> If there's any other unportable stuff you know of I should fix, let me know.

> directory happens to be.
