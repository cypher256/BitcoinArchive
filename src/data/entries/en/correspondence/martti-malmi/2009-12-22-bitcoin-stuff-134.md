Thanks for creating the maintenance account, it would have been 
impossible to do all that without it.  I'm really always going to need 
it.  OK, I changed the password to a 20 character random password.

That's a good domain.  People rarely type domain names anymore, they use 
autocomplete or click links on search engines.

I need to make a way for you to programmatically get new generated 
bitcoin addresses.  Either that or you could have them send to your IP 
address, but then you have to rely on them to put the order number in 
the comment.

When generating the new address, there can be an option to add an entry 
to the address book associated with the address, so the received 
transaction will be labelled.  I kinda hid the labels after early users 
found them confusing, but it would be very helpful for this application. 
  You have to widen up the comment column to see them.

Are you going to manually review and enter orders, at least to begin 
with?  I sure would.

I'm thinking I should move the UI in the direction of having the user 
ask for their bitcoin address when they want one.  "give me a bitcoin to 
receive a payment with".  I suppose next to the send button, there would 
by a receive button, you press it and it says "here's a new address to 
use, here's the button to copy it to the clipboard, do you want to label 
it?" and maybe some explanation about why you shouldn't reuse addresses.

Or maybe just a "New Address" button next to the address box that you 
should hit each time to change it.
