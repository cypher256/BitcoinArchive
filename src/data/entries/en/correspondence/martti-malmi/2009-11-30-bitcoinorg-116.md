I autogenerated the new logo at http://cooltext.com/, it's a good  
quick solution. You can try a wide variety of different logo styles  
there if you have the patience for the slow user interface.

>> The current site layout looks nice and simple. The logo just should be
>> changed. If we want to go live quickly, we can just replace it with the
>> site title and make a better logo later.
>>
>> If we need help with site administration or contacts to professional
>> web graphic artists, we can ask Dave. He does Drupal stuff for work.
