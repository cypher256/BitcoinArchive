Congratulations to Satoshi on this first alpha release. I am looking
forward to trying it out.

It's interesting that the system can be configured to only allow a
certain maximum number of coins ever to be generated. I guess the
idea is that the amount of work needed to generate a new coin will
become more difficult as time goes on.

One immediate problem with any new currency is how to value it. Even
ignoring the practical problem that virtually no one will accept it
at first, there is still a difficulty in coming up with a reasonable
argument in favor of a particular non-zero value for the coins.

As an amusing thought experiment, imagine that Bitcoin is successful
and becomes the dominant payment system in use throughout the world.
Then the total value of the currency should be equal to the total
value of all the wealth in the world. Current estimates of total
worldwide household wealth that I have found range from $100 trillion
to $300 trillion. With 20 million coins, that gives each coin a
value of about $10 million.

So the possibility of generating coins today with a few cents of
compute time may be quite a good bet, with a payoff of something
like 100 million to 1! Even if the odds of Bitcoin succeeding to
this degree are slim, are they really 100 million to one against?
Something to think about...
