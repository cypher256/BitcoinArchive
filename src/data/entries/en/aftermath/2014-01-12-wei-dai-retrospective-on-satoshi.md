*From LessWrong "Ask Any LessWronger Anything" (AALWA) thread, January 12, 2014:*

Wei Dai — creator of the b-money proposal (1998), cited as reference [1] in the Bitcoin whitepaper — shared his reflections on Satoshi Nakamoto:

**On independent invention:**

"My understanding is that the creator of Bitcoin, who goes by the name Satoshi Nakamoto, didn't even read my article before reinventing the idea himself. He learned about it afterward and credited me in his paper."

**On Satoshi's background:**

"My guess is that he's not anyone who was previously active in the academic cryptography or cypherpunks communities, because otherwise he probably would have been identified by now based on his writing and coding styles."

**On Satoshi's motivation:**

"I think he is not motivated mainly to personally make money, but to change the world and to solve an interesting technical problem."

He noted that if Satoshi were primarily motivated by money, "he would have sold at least some of his mined Bitcoins in order to spend or to diversify."

*[Wei Dai also expressed that Satoshi "might have been motivated more by a distrust of financial institutions and government monetary authorities and wanted to create a monetary system that didn't have to depend on such trust."]*
