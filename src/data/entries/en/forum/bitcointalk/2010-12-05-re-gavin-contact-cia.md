I've been invited to give a presentation about Bitcoin at an event at the CIA. I've agreed to go, and I plan to present Bitcoin as openly and transparently as possible. I want to make a good first impression with the government by being straightforward about what Bitcoin is and isn't.

I think it's better to explain Bitcoin to them directly than to have them learn about it through misconceptions.
