I don't know what it was. It started working again when I rebooted it.  
Someone suggested it might have been the heavy load from a Reddit post  
about Bitcoin. Inspecting the logs would be useful, but I don't have  
much time now.

I told him to go ahead. I don't do automatic backups atm. We should  
have more server admins soon when I get bitcoinexchange.com to another  
server. I could give the root password to you and somebody else. Xunie  
has volunteered, but we might find somebody even more professional  outage was due to heavy load, he could help us move to lighttpd or  
optimize resources otherwise. Should we make a recruitment thread on  
the forum?
