On December 12, 2010, at 18:22:33 UTC, Satoshi Nakamoto made his 575th and final post on the BitcoinTalk forum. The post announced Bitcoin version 0.3.19 with DoS protection improvements:

> There's more work to do on DoS, but I'm doing a quick build of what I have so far in case it's needed, before venturing into more complex ideas.

There was no farewell. No announcement of departure. Just a routine technical update — consistent with how Satoshi had always communicated: impersonal, focused on the work, devoid of emotion.

One week earlier, on December 5, 2010, Satoshi had posted a warning about WikiLeaks considering Bitcoin for donations:

> No, don't "bring it on."

And in a separate thread:

> The project needs to grow gradually so the software can be strengthened along the way. I make this appeal to WikiLeaks not to try to use Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a small beta community in its infancy.

Satoshi continued communicating privately with a few developers for several more months. His last known email to Mike Hearn was sent on April 23, 2011, and his final known email to Gavin Andresen was sent on April 26, 2011. He was never heard from again — except for a single disputed post on P2P Foundation on March 7, 2014, stating "I am not Dorian Nakamoto."
