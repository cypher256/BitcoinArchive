I'm moving in the direction of making transactions automated only when  
the customer buys coins with SMS payment provided by ZayPay. Pecunix  
is the only reliable and practical enough e-currency that I'd store my  
reserves in, but the exchange fees are quite high (about 5%).

When I'm buying coins, my recommended payment method would be IBAN  
transfer. I could also say "contact us if you want to buy/sell with  
any other payment option" and handle each order separately. I could  
manually accept single orders with even PayPal, as long as I don't  
store my money there and the customer pays the fees.
