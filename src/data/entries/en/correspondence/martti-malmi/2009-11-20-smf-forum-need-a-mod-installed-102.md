DNS entry.

I'm thinking of merging the bitcoin.org information with your site 
content so I can switch the whole bitcoin.org domain over.  We need to 
replace the current bitcoin.org site with a user-oriented site before 
the release.

If the website and forum switch at the same time, then forum.bitcoin.org 
isn't necessary unless we want it that way for looks.

Have you decided on the CMS to use?  I should research Drupal and other 
CMSes and see what's the most popular.

The linux version, setup exe, tor option and better website/forum will 
all increase the percentage of visitors who can use it, and the 
autostart and minimize to tray will increase how many keep running it. 
All those factors multiply together.

It's good to start low and only have the price go up.

I really like that he explains the concept that the cost of electricity 
is a minimum floor under the price.  At a minimum you either have to pay 
the cost in electricity or pay someone the cost of production to make 
them for you.
