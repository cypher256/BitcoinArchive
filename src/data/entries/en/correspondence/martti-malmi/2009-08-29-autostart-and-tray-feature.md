In a series of emails from late August 2009, Satoshi and Malmi discussed critical UI improvements for the Bitcoin client. Malmi had successfully compiled Bitcoin using wxPack and was working on new features.

On August 28, Malmi suggested promoting Bitcoin within virtual gaming communities and asked about configuration file implementations. The next day, Satoshi responded with strong views on the importance of autostart and minimize-to-tray functionality:

Satoshi emphasized that autostart with system tray minimization was "a must-have feature" for retaining nodes on the network. He drew a comparison to early file-sharing networks, noting how similar background-running strategies had been essential to those networks' success and growth.

By September 16, 2009, Malmi reported that he had committed code implementing the minimize-to-tray features to SVN branches. By October, he had created a Windows installer with both autostart and minimize-to-tray functionality.

These features were included in Bitcoin version 0.2, released in December 2009, which also included Linux support. Satoshi publicly acknowledged Malmi's contribution in the release notes: "Many thanks to Martti (Sirius-m) for all his development work."
