Do you know what caused that outage?  Did it need to be rebooted, or was 
it a DoS or something?  The IP was pingable during the outage.

Did you get back to davidonpda about his doing a mirror backup?  I think 
that's a really good idea.  Do you do any backups, or the VPS do any for 
you automatically?
