I was very interested to read your b-money page. I'm getting ready to release a paper that expands on your ideas into a complete working system. Adam Back (hashcash.org) noticed the similarities and pointed me to your site.

I need to find out the year of publication of your b-money page for the citation in my paper. It'll look like:

[1] W. Dai, "b-money," http://www.weidai.com/bmoney.txt, 1998.

Thanks,
Satoshi
