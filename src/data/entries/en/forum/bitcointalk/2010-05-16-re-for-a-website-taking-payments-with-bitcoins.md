[Quote from: Xunie on May 14, 2010, 09:52:53 PM](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=129.msg1124#msg1124)I suggest we disable IP transactions while the user uses a Proxy!
Just to be on the safe side.
That's a good idea.  At the very least a warning dialog explaining that it'll connect to the IP and send the information cleartext, giving the chance to cancel.
