In July 2020, blockchain tracking service Whale Alert published "The Satoshi Fortune," an independent analysis of Satoshi Nakamoto's mining activity that corroborated and refined earlier Patoshi research by Sergio Demian Lerner.

**Key findings:**

- Satoshi mined **1,125,150 BTC** up to block 54,316
- **22,503** of the first 54,316 blocks were mined by the Patoshi miner
- Of these, only **50 blocks (907 BTC)** had ever been spent; the remaining **1,122,693 BTC** were untouched
- Estimated value at the time of publication: at least **$10.9 billion**

**Mining behavior:**

Whale Alert found that Satoshi maintained a steady share of approximately **60% of the network hashrate** as the network grew, using an estimated **48 computers** (or CPU threads). Satoshi systematically adjusted processing power to mine approximately **3.6 blocks per hour**, ensuring sufficient hashrate to defend against a 51% attack while the network was still vulnerable.

**Intentional throttling:**

The analysis identified a pattern of deliberate hashrate reduction over time. As other miners joined the network, Satoshi did not compete for dominance but instead progressively decreased mining speed. The Patoshi miner was shut down entirely in **May 2010**, months before Satoshi's final communications.

**Conclusion:**

The report concluded: "The timing of the shutdown, the mining behavior, the systematic decrease in mining speed and the lack of spending strongly suggest that Satoshi was only interested in growing and protecting the young network." None of the 1,125,150 BTC have ever been spent, reinforcing the interpretation that Satoshi mined to bootstrap the network — not for personal enrichment.
