Please promise me you won't make a switch now.  The last thing we need 
is switchover hassle on top of the slashdot flood of work we've got now. 
  I'm losing my mind there are so many things that need to be done.

Also, it would suck to be on a smaller, less reliable host just to save 
a measly $20.

I will try to think of a polite way to ask the donor if he sent it, but 
right now there are other higher priority things that are going to bump 
even that for a few days.

Would a donation of bitcoins help in the short term?
