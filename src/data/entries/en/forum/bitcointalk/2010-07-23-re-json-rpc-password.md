[Quote from: gavinandresen on July 23, 2010, 03:11:45 PM](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=461.msg5296#msg5296)Question for everybody:  should I add a section to the wiki page describing, in detail, how to do HTTP Basic authentication?  PHP and Python make is really easy-- just use the [http://user:pass@host:port/](http://user:pass@host:port/) URL syntax.
Yes, I think that would be really good so each dev doesn't have to figure it out themselves.  We need a simple example for each of Python, PHP and Java importing the json-rpc library and using it to do a getinfo or something, including doing the http authentication part.
