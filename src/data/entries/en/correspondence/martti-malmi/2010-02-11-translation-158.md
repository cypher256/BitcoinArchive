I didn't make any changes to Drupal code.  The only thing other than 
installing themes was the .htaccess file (which really is needed, it 
didn't work in the global config file).

It was only SMF where I made some PHP changes.

You might find it preferable not to translate it into your own language. 
  Often the standard answer about legalities is that it's only intended 
for people in other countries.  Translating it into your home language 
weakens that argument.
