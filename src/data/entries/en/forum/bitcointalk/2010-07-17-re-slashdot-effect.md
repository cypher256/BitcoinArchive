I'm glad the Slashdot crowd can see Bitcoin. We're really in the right position to take advantage of the Slashdot effect.

When a mainstream article is written about Bitcoin, it drives new users. First impressions matter. I've been working on making the interface cleaner and the download smaller.

We want to make sure the software is as easy to use as possible for newcomers. The P2P network has been handling the traffic just fine.
