Hi!

How are you doing? Haven't seen you around in a while.

I've been at full-time work lately, and will be until the end of June,  
so I haven't had that much time to work with Bitcoin or my exchange  
service. I have a working beta of my service though, and a few weeks  
ago made my first transaction: sold 10,000 btc for 20 euros via EU  
bank transfer. Maybe I can make it public soon.

I divided the forum into 6 boards, which are Bitcoin Discussion,  
Development & Technical Discussion, Technical support, Economics,  
Marketplace and Trading Discussion. Hope this is ok?

I also added a page "Trade" on the bitcoin.org site, where  
btc-accepting services are listed. It's nice to see that there are  
already useful services that accept btc.

The community has been growing nicely. We've had around 10-20 people  
and active discussion at #bitcoin-dev lately.

It would be nice to get the daemon-able binaries to SF.net. We have  
some skilled programmers in the community now, so maybe we can finish  
the JSON API functions if you don't have time to.

Best regards.
