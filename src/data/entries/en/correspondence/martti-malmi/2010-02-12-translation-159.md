I'm not too worried about that, since I'm not doing anything illegal,  
even with my exchange service. If I were, it wouldn't help me that I'm  
only offering the service for foreigners. Things may of course be  
different under other jurisdictions, but that's how it is in my  
country. The law monopoly here is less uncivilized than many others.
