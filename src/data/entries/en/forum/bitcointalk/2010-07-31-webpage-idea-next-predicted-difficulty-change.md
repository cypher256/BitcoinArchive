It would be neat if someone had a page (like that handy calculator at [http://www.alloscomp.com/bitcoin/calculator.php](http://www.alloscomp.com/bitcoin/calculator.php)) that projects what the next difficulty adjustment will be.

projected difficulty adjustment multiplier = 

 blocks_since_last_adjustment / 2016
 ------------------------------------
 time_since_last_adjustment / 14_days

For instance, if it already got half way to the next adjustment in only 3.5 days instead of 7, we would expect difficulty to double:

 (1008/2016) / (3.5/14) = 0.5/0.25 = 2.0

Also, it could show the predicted time when the next adjustment will occur, and tell when the last adjustment was and how much it changed.
