I wasn't satisfied with my custom2 theme.  It felt crowded, the 
header/logo seemed wrong and the heavy left margin stationery style is 
outdated.

custom3 online now is a more standard layout similar to a lot of 
commercial software homepages.  Maybe it's just me, but I really like 
the random blue squares.
