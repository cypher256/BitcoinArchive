On Windows, findstr /c:"version message" debug.log

It looks like the bad chain was on block 74678 recently.  Can't wait to overtake it.

On the stats at [http://nullvoid.org/bitcoin/statistix.php](http://nullvoid.org/bitcoin/statistix.php)  there's been 5 blocks per hour in the last 3 hours.  We had a difficulty adjustment about a day ago that should have put it back to 6 blocks per hour.
