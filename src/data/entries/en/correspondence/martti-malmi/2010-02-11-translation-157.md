I got the translations working correctly, now it should automatically  
detect the language from the browser settings. Choosing manually is of  
course also possible. I asked the translators to send me their  
translations as pm or e-mail. I guess I'll make a Finnish translation  
myself at some point. Multiple translations add to the site's  
credibility.

Drupal is asking to do a security update. Do we have other customized  
files we need to backup than those located in the "sites" directory?
