I'm getting ready to release a paper that expands on your ideas into a complete working system.

I wanted to make sure I have the citation to your hashcash paper right.

*[Satoshi included a link to a pre-release draft of what would become the Bitcoin whitepaper. The draft was titled "Electronic Cash Without a Trusted Third Party" and filed as ecash.pdf — predating the October 3 draft which was retitled to "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System."]*

*[Source: This email was entered into evidence during the COPA v. Craig Wright trial in London, February 2024. Adam Back filed the complete email chain as a witness statement.]*
