Liberty Reserve sounds good. I could first make a service that only  
accepts LR, and add more options later. The weakness is that buying LR  
is an extra step of inconvenience when the customer just wants to get  
Bitcoins. But maybe I don't have too much choice here.

Yes, electronic bank transfer is available. During 2010 most European  
countries will become a part of SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area),  
which means that all payments within Europe are to be considered  
domestic. Banks will have to apply the same fees and standards to all  
domestic transfers, so they'll probably all be free of charge and  
complete in one bank day. For international transfers there's the  
SWIFT/IBAN system, which usually costs some extra.

A longer term project for my exchange service would be to see what  
kinds of integration options the banks have to offer. Bank transfers  
would reach nearly as many customers as credit cards do.
