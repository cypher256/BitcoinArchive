I've been trying to encourage someone to write and release some sample Python code showing the recommended way to do the typical accounting stuff, but to no avail.  It would be nice if you didn't have to re-invent the wheel like you're doing here.  Search on getnewaddress and you should find a thread where I gave a small fragment of sample pseudocode.
