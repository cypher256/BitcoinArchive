Bitcoin seems to be a very promising idea. I like the idea of basing
security on the assumption that the CPU power of honest participants
outweighs that of the attacker. It is a very modern notion that exploits
the power of the long tail. When Wikipedia started I never thought it
would work, but it has proven to be a great success for some of the same
reasons.

I also do think that there is potential value in a form of unforgeable
token whose production rate is predictable and can't be influenced by
corrupt parties. This would be more analogous to gold than to fiat
currencies. Nick Szabo wrote many years ago about what he called "bit
gold" and this could be an implementation of that concept. There have
also been proposals for building light-weight anonymous payment schemes
on top of heavy-weight non-anonymous systems, so Bitcoin could be
leveraged to allow for anonymization.

It's important for the network to not be easily overwhelmed or taken over
by a well-funded attacker. I'd appreciate it if Satoshi could address
some of these questions, or point to where in the paper he already has.
