I have a prototype of the bitcoinexchange.com service up now (auth:  
bitcoin/bit). It's running on the Python-powered Django web  
application framework, which is a pleasure to work with, compared to  
php.

I'll have to do some studying for a few days now, after which I can  
return to work with the exchange service. Among other things I'll fix  
the pricing so that the price of Bitcoins grows towards infinity when  
my supply of them gets closer to zero. That way I can find the market  
rate and stay at the point where supply meets demand. I'm not yet  
completely sure what the parameters of the hyperbolic pricing curve  
should be, so that's something to think about.
