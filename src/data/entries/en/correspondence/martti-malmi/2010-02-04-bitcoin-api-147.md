Good, then no need to consider d-bus.  Is there something like IPC 
sockets on Windows?  I guess we could look how wx does it, or maybe the 
XML-RPC library will already know what to do.  Windows has named pipes, 
maybe that's the best analogue.

I don't think I want to invent my own RPC protocol, I want to use an 
existing standard.  PHP, Java, Python or anything will be able to talk 
to the server directly the same way the command line commands do.

I'm going to start reading on XML-RPC.  It's coming up in searches as 
the most widely used protocol and widely supported.  PHP includes it in 
its standard libraries.
