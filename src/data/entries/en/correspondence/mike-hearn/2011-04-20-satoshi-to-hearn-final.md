In one of his last known emails, Satoshi wrote to Mike Hearn:

"I've moved on to other things. It's in good hands with Gavin and everyone."

This email, sent in April 2011, is among the final known communications from Satoshi Nakamoto before his complete withdrawal from all public and private correspondence.
