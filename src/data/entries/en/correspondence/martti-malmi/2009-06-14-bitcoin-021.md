Thanks, I've been really busy lately.

I registered username "satoshi".  Since there's no SSL login, I want to 
mainly use that account with sub-admin powers and use the admin account 
as little as possible.  I created a "Moderators" group to give my 
satoshi account as much editing control as possible without the ability 
to overthrow everything.

There's something weird with the download bar on the right covering 
things up, like on the new account registration it covers up the entry 
fields unless you make the browser really wide, and the homepage it 
covers up the screenshots.  (with Firefox)
