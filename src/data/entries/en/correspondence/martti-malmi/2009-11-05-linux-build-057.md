I merged the linux changes into the main trunk on SVN.  It compiles and 
runs now.  I think all the problems are in the UI.  The menus quickly 
quit working and it doesn't repaint when it's supposed to unless I 
resize it, and the UI is getting some segfaults.  Shouldn't be too hard 
to debug with gdb.  I haven't tested if it plays nice with other nodes 
yet so keep it off-net.
