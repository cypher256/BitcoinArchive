Glad that worked, it's a pain that the dependencies are so big and hard 
to build.  Some of them give little attention to the Windows build. 
Next time I update to the latest versions, maybe I'll lay everything out 
in one directory tree and bundle the whole thing up into a giant archive.

I'm not sure they had wxPack before.  I'm glad they got that so everyone 
doesn't have to build wxWidgets themselves.  OpenSSL is the harder one 
to build.

I reduced the EXE size by running strip.exe on it to take out the debug 
symbols.  That's with mingw.  That's the better compiler, I only used VC 
  for debugging.
